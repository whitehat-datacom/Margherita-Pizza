Step 1:
First, in a large bowl mix together 1.5 teaspoons instant yeast and ½ teaspoon of sugar.

Usually instant yeast can be mixed directly in the flour or in water at room temperature. Add 2 teaspoons dry active yeast for this pizza crust recipe.
Step 2:
Add 1 cup of lukewarm water (44 degrees Celsius) and stir. Set aside and let the yeast activate.

TIP: The water has to be lukewarm and not hot or cold. Hot water will kill the yeast and cooler water won’t activate the dry active yeast.
Step 3:
You should start to see the yeast mixture bubbling up and doubling in size after about 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 4:
Combine 1 cup of unbleached all purpose flour (or bread flour) with 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 tablespoons of olive oil.Stir with a whisk or wooden spoon or steel spoon. Add one more cup of the flour.
 Keep on stirring. The mixture will be quite sticky
 Step 5:
  Add the last cup of flour and continue to stir. The dough will start to form and leave the sides of the bowl, but will still be sticky. Add the last cup of flour and continue to stir. The dough will start to form and leave the sides of the bowl, but will still be sticky.
  Step 6:
  Keep your dough in the deep bowl, and lightly apply a bit of olive oil all around the outside of the dough. This will keep it from sticking to the sides of the bowl once the dough proves and grows.

Cover loosely with a kitchen napkin or towel, and let rest at room temperature for the dough to leaven:

45 minutes to 1 hour for instant yeast
1.5 to 2 hours for dry active yeast
Step 7:
After exactly 1 hour my dough had risen and doubled up to what you see below.

If you plan to make the pizza the next day, then wrap the dough tightly in a plastic wrap and keep in the fridge.To make the pizza right away, portion and flatten the dough to a disk. In the below photo, you can see that the dough has leavened well, with stringy strands and many air pockets that will make a chewy crust.
Step 8:
First, preheat the oven to the highest temperature in your oven. In my oven it is 230 degrees Celsius (450 degrees Fahrenheit). Grease a round metal baking pan with olive oil, and then lightly dust it with maize flour (cornmeal), semolina (rava or sooji) or flour.
Step 9:
 Divide the pizza dough into equals parts to make either 4 small or 2 large or 3 medium size pizzas. Wrap any dough you’re not using in plastic wrap and keep in the fridge for up to 3 days total.

To store in the freezer for up to 3 months, lightly coat the dough in olive oil and seal in an airtight freezer storage bag.
Step 10:
Using clean, dry hands, take one portion of the divided dough and roll it into a neat round ball. Place on a cutting board or countertop that’s been lightly coated with some flour, and sprinkle the dough with a light dusting of more flour.Use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a large round or oval shape of about ⅛ to ¼ inch thickness. Roll the dough from the center towards the outer edges for the most even pizza dough. You may have to dust the surface with flour as you work.

A pizza dough is always stretched with hands and not rolled. Stretching the dough with your hands needs practice. For most home cooks, rolling the dough is much easier and so I have included this step. You could also flatten and press the dough with your fingers directly in the baking pan.

I do stretch or flatten the dough with my hands but not everyone is good at this. Thus rolling makes it easier. If you are a master at stretching dough with your hands, then go ahead with this technique.
Step 11:
Once stretched to the desired size, gently place the pizza base in the greased baking pan. Be careful not to tear the dough, as it is very soft and stretchy. At this point you can prick the dough with a fork if you want a thinner, crisper crust. This also helps in the crust not puffing up when baking. However, you can leave the dough as-is for a fluffier, chewier veg pizza crust.Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the surface of the crust with olive oil.
Step 12:
Then, spread the tomato sauce,pizza topping,chilli sauce,mayonaise on the pizza in a thin, even layer. Leave about an inch of dough around the outer edge free from sauce for a perfect pizza crust.
Step 13:
Top the sauce with a generous handful or two of shredded mozzarella cheese.Place your choice of veggies on top of the cheese, making sure to spread the toppings evenly.Next, add a light layer of grated parmesan cheese to finish the pizza.
Step 14:
Bake the veg pizza in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cheese melts and the crust is golden.

Alternatively preheat a baking sheet in the oven for 20 minutes when you assemble the pizza in the baking pan. Place the pan with the pizza on the hot baking sheet which will help in getting a crisp crust.
